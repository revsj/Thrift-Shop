One thing I've learned on this journey is the importance of passion, anything that you're passionate about feels meaningful.
 It gives you a feeling of direction and fulfilment in life.. it doesn’t matter how messed up your idea is in the beginning 
but as you think for more and more you could bottle things up and just write it in a piece of paper. As time went by you could see 
the progress you had made not because of how good or nice your idea was, but because you believed that your idea had some sort of potential so you continued it. 
By the end of the day you’re surprised that “oh I’ve made this, wow” sheesh ganun ung feeling  even if you have faced so many setbacks. As humans it’s normal to take things for a min 
like go for a walk or do something to ease your frustration but I happen to know that you should finish what you’ve started and also enjoy things and be proud.  

In this video, I'll take you through our journey from inception to the final presentation of our website creation. So, sit back, relax, grab some snacks, and immerse yourself in the progress we've made. Enjoy the journey!
